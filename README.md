ORCAE is an online genome annotation resource offering users the necessary
tools and information to validate and correct gene annotations. The system is
built on the wiki philosophy, all modifications to a certain gene are stored
and can be found back in the annotation history of that gene. See
https://orcae.psb.ugent.be/.
